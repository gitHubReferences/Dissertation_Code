This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation for our dissertation on housing price analysis and prediction. The research focuses on the impact of various legislative changes and economic events on the housing market in Dublin, Ireland. We utilize econometric models such as ITS, ARIMA and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) to analyze historical data and evaluate the effects of interventions like Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs), and Brexit.
